The Main Regulators of the Soil Microbiome
Most of the living biomass on Earth is comprised of microorganisms [1]. Soil, in particular, harbours an enormous diversity and abundance of microbial life referred to, collectively, as the soil
microbiome [2,3]. The soil microbiome is mainly comprised of soil bacteria and fungi, which reside
in the bulk and/or in the rhizosphere soil. The diversity and abundance of soil bacteria and fungi
are responsible for a vast number of vital ecosystem functions and services, such as primary production, carbon sequestration, and nutrient mineralization [4]. Ecologists and microbiologists
have thus sought for a long time to understand the factors that regulate the structure, composition, and function of soil bacteria and fungi.
It has been suggested that soil abiotic properties, such as pH and organic matter content,
are the principal regulators of the structure and composition of soil bacteria and fungi [2,5].
Moreover, studies have consistently shown that the community composition of soil bacteria
and fungi also depends on several biotic factors [6,7]. Broadly, there are two biotic factors
that regulate soil bacterial and fungal communities, particularly at the finer spatial scales:
litter input and rhizodeposition by plants, and top-down regulation by the predators
of bacteria and fungi. While the important role of plant inputs (bottom-up regulation)
in influencing the soil microbiome at various spatial scales has received greater attention
[8,9], the role of a wide range of soil predators that directly and indirectly affect soil bacterial
and fungal communities has received relatively less attention in the soil microbiome
literature [2,10].
